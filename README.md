# Fedora Release Schedule Planner

Application for better release planning and schedule presentation.
This is an implementation of the actual Fedora project, [release-schedule-planner](https://codeberg.org/fedora/release-schedule-planner), but using [FastAPI ](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) instead of [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/).

## Why?

I am making this because I believe FastAPI makes making APIs easier due to the automatic documentation it has built-in. This should make things move faster in general.
